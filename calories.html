<h1> Sugar and fat </h1>
<p> Many fast-food meals have added sugar. That means extra calories and also little nutrition.The American Heart Association suggests only eating 100 to 150 calories of added sugar per day. That is about 6 to 9 teaspoons. Many fast-food drinks alone hold well over 12 ounces. A 12-ounce can of soda contains 8 teaspoons of sugar. That equals 130 calories, 39 grams of sugar, and nothing else.
