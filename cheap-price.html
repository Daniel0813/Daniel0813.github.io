<p>A normal Mcdonald's combos that consists of a large burger, a fries, and a drink would cost around $7-$8. It can easily make a grown adult feel full. Just buying a burger and a drink would only cost around $5, and if you choose small burgers, you can get two of them with the same price.There are obviously many other choices of meal, but they are all very cheap in general.</P>
