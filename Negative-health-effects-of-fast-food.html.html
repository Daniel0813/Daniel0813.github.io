<h1> Sugar and fat </h1>
<p1> Many fast-food meals have added sugar. That means extra calories and also little nutrition.The American Heart Association suggests only eating 100 to 150 calories of added sugar per day. That¡¯s about six to nine teaspoons. Many fast-food drinks alone hold well over 12 ounces. A 12-ounce can of soda contains 8 teaspoons of sugar. That equals 130 calories, 39 grams of sugar, and nothing else. Here is a table of nutrition values conttains in a Mcdonald's Big Mac.
